= (Preview) Switching between Topic Operator modes

[role="_abstract"]
You can switch between topic management modes when upgrading or downgrading Strimzi, or when using the same version of Strimzi, as long as the mode is supported for that version. 

* To switch from the default unidirectional mode to bidirectional mode you have to xref:ref-operator-unidirectional-topic-operator-feature-gate-str[disable the `UnidirectionalTopicOperator` feature gate], and check whether finalizers are being used to control topic deletion. If `KafkaTopic` resources are using finalizers, ensure that you do one of the following  before making the switch:
** xref:con-removing-topic-finalizers-{context}[Remove all finalizers from topics].
** Disable the finalizers by setting the `STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZERS` environment variable to `false` in the Topic Operator `env` configuration.

env:
  - name: STRIMZI_USE_FINALIZERS

Use the same configuration for a Topic Operator running in a Strimzi-managed cluster or as a standalone deployment.  

The Topic Operator does not use finalizers in bidirectional mode.
If they are retained after making the switch from unidirectional mode, you won't be able to delete `KafkaTopic` and related resources.
