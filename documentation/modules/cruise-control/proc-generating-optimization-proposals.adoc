= Generating optimization proposals 

When you create or update a `KafkaRebalance` resource, Cruise Control generates an xref:con-optimization-proposals-{context}[optimization proposal] for the Kafka cluster based on the configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals].

Analyze the information in the optimization proposal and decide whether to approve it.

You can run the rebalancing by using one of the three available modes: `full`, `add-brokers` and `remove-brokers`.
It depends if you need the rebalancing across all the brokers already running in the cluster, after a scaling up or before a scaling down.
More information are available in the xref:con-rebalance-{context}[Rebalancing] related section.

.Prerequisites

* You have xref:proc-deploying-cruise-control-{context}[deployed Cruise Control] to your Strimzi cluster.

* You have configured xref:con-optimization-goals-{context}[optimization goals] and, optionally, xref:capacity-configuration[capacity limits on broker resources].

.Procedure

. Create a `KafkaRebalance` resource:

.. To use the _default optimization goals_ defined in the `Kafka` resource, leave the `spec` property empty.
It runs the rebalancing with `full` mode by default.
+

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec: {}
----
+
You can also run the same type of rebalancing by specifying the `full` mode through the `spec.mode` field.
+

metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: full
----
+
If you want to run the rebalance right after scaling up the Apache Kafka cluster and need to move already existing replicas to the newly added brokers, use the `add-brokers` mode.
+

----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:

  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: add-brokers
  brokers: [3, 4] <1>
----
<1> List of newly added brokers by the scale up operation. This is mandatory.
+
If you want safely scale down the Apache Kafka cluster, consider to run a rebalance before to do so in order to move replicas off the brokers that are going to be removed.
Use the `remove-brokers` mode in this case.
+

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}

spec:
  mode: remove-brokers
  brokers: [3, 4] <1>
----
<1> List of brokers to be removed by the scale down operation. This is mandatory.
+
All the steps following in this procedure are actually the same whatever is the mode you are using.
.. To configure _user-provided optimization goals_ instead of using the default goals, add the `goals` property and enter one or more goals.
+
In the following example, rack awareness and replica capacity are configured as user-provided optimization goals:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:    
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
----

.. To ignore the configured hard goals, add the `skipHardGoalCheck: true` property:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaRebalanceApiVersion}
kind: KafkaRebalance
metadata:
  name: my-rebalance
  labels: 
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:    
  goals:
    - RackAwareGoal
    - ReplicaCapacityGoal
  skipHardGoalCheck: true
----

. Create or update the resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl apply -f _your-file_
----
+
The Cluster Operator requests the optimization proposal from Cruise Control.
This might take a few minutes depending on the size of the Kafka cluster. 

. Check the status of the `KafkaRebalance` resource:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
kubectl describe kafkarebalance _rebalance-cr-name_
----
+
Cruise Control returns one of two statuses:

** `PendingProposal`: The rebalance operator is polling the Cruise Control API to check if the optimization proposal is ready.

** `ProposalReady`: The optimization proposal is ready for review and, if desired, approval.
The optimization proposal is contained in the `Status.Optimization Result` property of the `KafkaRebalance` resource.

. Review the optimization proposal.

The properties in the `Optimization Result` section describe the pending cluster rebalance operation. 
For descriptions of each property, see xref:contents-optimization-proposals[Contents of optimization proposals].

.Insufficient CPU capacity

If a Kafka cluster is overloaded in terms of CPU utilization, you might see an insufficient CPU capacity error in the `KafkaRebalance` status.
It's worth noting that this utilization value is unaffected by the `excludedTopics` configuration. 
Although optimization proposals will not reassign replicas of excluded topics, their load is still considered in the utilization calculation.

.Example CPU utilization error
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
----
com.linkedin.kafka.cruisecontrol.exception.OptimizationFailureException:
        [CpuCapacityGoal] Insufficient capacity for cpu (Utilization 615.21,
        Allowed Capacity 420.00, Threshold: 0.70). Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0. Add at least 3 brokers with
        the same cpu capacity (100.00) as broker-0.
----

[NOTE]
====
The error shows CPU capacity as a percentage rather than CPU cores. For that reason, it does not directly map to the number of CPUs configured in Kafka CR.
It is like having a single _virtual_ CPU per broker, which has the cycles of `Kafka.spec.kafka.resources.limits.cpu` CPUs.
This has no effect on the rebalance behavior, since the ratio between CPU utilization and capacity remains the same.
