= Strimzi downgrade paths

[role="_abstract"]
Two downgrade paths are available for Strimzi.

Incremental downgrade::
An incremental downgrade involves downgrading Strimzi from version {ProductVersion} to the previous minor version.

Multi-version downgrade::
A multi-version downgrade involves downgrading from version {ProductVersion} to an older version of Strimzi within a single upgrade, skipping one or more intermediate versions. 
Downgrading to some older versions may not be sucessful, for example, due to configuration changes or extra steps for a particular Kafka version upgrade path performed by later versions that the target version is unable to undo. It is therefore necessary to validate your wanted downgrade path before attempting in a production environment. See table <<downgrade-version-limitations>> for details on specific paths.

== Support for Kafka versions when downgrading

When downgrading Strimzi, it is important to ensure compatibility with the Kafka version being used.

Multi-version downgrades are possible even if the supported Kafka versions differ between the old and new versions. 
However, if you attempt to downgrade to an older Strimzi version that does not support the current Kafka version, xref:con-downgrade-cluster-operator-unsupported-kafka-str[an error indicating that the Kafka version is not supported is generated]. 
In this case, you must, if possible, downgrade the Kafka version as part of the Strimzi downgrade by changing the `spec.kafka.version` in the `Kafka` custom resource to the supported version for the target Strimzi version. If it is not possible to downgrade the Kafka version (for example in Strimzi version 0.45.0 or earlier), then the Strimzi downgrade path you are attempting is not supported. 

The following table details known limitations for specific downgrade paths.
