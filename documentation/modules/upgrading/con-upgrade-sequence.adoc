= Required upgrade sequence

[role="_abstract"]
To upgrade brokers and clients without downtime, you _must_ complete the Strimzi upgrade procedures in the following order:

. Make sure your Kubernetes cluster version is supported.
+
Strimzi {ProductVersion} requires Kubernetes {KubernetesVersion}.
+
You can xref:con-upgrade-cluster-{context}[upgrade Kubernetes with minimal downtime].

. xref:assembly-upgrade-{context}[Upgrade the Cluster Operator].

. Update the xref:proc-upgrade-kafka-kraft-{context}[Kafka `version` and `metadataVersion`].

NOTE: From Strimzi 0.39, upgrades and downgrades between KRaft-based clusters are supported.
