= Strimzi upgrade paths

[role="_abstract"]
Two Strimzi upgrade paths are possible.

Incremental upgrade::
Upgrading Strimzi from the previous minor version to version {ProductVersion}.

Multi-version upgrade::
Upgrading Strimzi from an old version to version {ProductVersion} within a single upgrade (skipping one or more intermediate versions).
+
For example, upgrading from Strimzi 0.24.0 directly to Strimzi {ProductVersion}.
+
NOTE: A multi-version Strimzi upgrade might still support the current version of a Kafka deployment.

== Supported Kafka versions

Decide which Kafka version to upgrade to before starting the Strimzi upgrade process.
You can review supported Kafka versions in the link:https://strimzi.io/downloads/[Supported versions^] table.

* The *Operators* column lists all released Strimzi versions (the Strimzi version is often called the "Operator version").

* The *Kafka versions* column lists the supported Kafka versions for each Strimzi version.

You can only use a Kafka version supported by the version of Strimzi you are using.
You can upgrade to a higher Kafka version as long as it is supported by your version of Strimzi.
In some cases, you can also downgrade to a previous supported Kafka version.

[id='con-upgrade-paths-earlier-versions-{context}']
== Upgrading from a Strimzi version earlier than {ConvertAfterProductVersion}

When upgrading Strimzi to {ProductVersion} from {ConvertAfterProductVersion} or earlier, you must ensure that your custom resources are using API version `{ApiVersion}`.
You must upgrade the Custom Resource Definitions and the custom resources *before* upgrading to Strimzi {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} or newer.
To perform the upgrade, you can use the _API conversion tool_ provided with Strimzi {LastReleaseWithCRDUpgrade}.
For more information, see the {UpgradeGuide}.

The `v1beta2` API version for all custom resources was introduced with Strimzi {ConvertAfterProductVersion}.
For Strimzi {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} and newer, the `v1alpha1` and `v1beta1` API versions were removed from all Strimzi custom resources apart from `KafkaTopic` and `KafkaUser`.

If you are upgrading from a Strimzi version prior to version {ConvertAfterProductVersion}:

. Upgrade Strimzi to {ConvertAfterProductVersion}
. Convert the custom resources to `v1beta2`
. Upgrade Strimzi to {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} or newer

NOTE: As an alternative, you can install the custom resources from version {ConvertAfterProductVersion}, convert the resources, and then upgrade to {ConvertBeforeProductVersion} or newer.
