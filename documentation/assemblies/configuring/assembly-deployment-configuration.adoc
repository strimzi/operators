= Configuring a Strimzi deployment

[role="_abstract"]
This chapter describes how to configure different aspects of the supported deployments using custom resources:

* Kafka clusters
* Kafka Connect clusters
* Kafka MirrorMaker
* Kafka Bridge
* Cruise Control

NOTE: Labels applied to a custom resource are also applied to the Kubernetes resources making up its cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.
