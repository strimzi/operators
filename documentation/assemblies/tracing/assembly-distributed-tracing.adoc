= Introducing distributed tracing

Distributed tracing allows you to track the progress of transactions between applications in a distributed system. In a microservices architecture, tracing tracks the progress of transactions between services. Trace data is useful for monitoring application performance and investigating issues with target systems and end-user applications.

In Strimzi, tracing facilitates the end-to-end tracking of messages: from source systems to Kafka, and then from Kafka to target systems and applications. It complements the metrics that are available to view in link:{BookURLDeploying}#assembly-metrics-setup-{context}[Grafana dashboards], as well as the component loggers.

Support for tracing is built in to the following Kafka components:

* Kafka Connect
* MirrorMaker
* MirrorMaker 2.0
* Strimzi Kafka Bridge

Tracing is not supported for Kafka brokers.

You enable and configure tracing for these components through their custom resources. 
You enable tracing by specifying a tracing type using the `spec.tracing.type` property:

* `opentelemetry` for OpenTelemetry with the Jaeger Exporter
* `jaeger` for OpenTracing with Jaeger

You add tracing configuration using `spec.template` properties. 

[NOTE]
====
Support for `type: jaeger` tracing is deprecated.
The Jaeger clients are now retired and the OpenTracing project archived.
As such, we cannot guarantee their support for future Kafka versions.
If possible, we will maintain the support for `type: jaeger` tracing until June 2023 and remove it afterwards.
Please migrate to OpenTelemetry as soon as possible.
====

To enable tracing in Kafka producers, consumers, and Kafka Streams API applications, you _instrument_ application code. 
When instrumented, clients generate trace data; for example, when producing messages or writing offsets to the log.

[NOTE]
====
Setting up tracing for applications and systems beyond Strimzi is outside the scope of this content.

== Outline of procedures

To set up tracing for Strimzi, follow these procedures in order:

* xref:proc-enabling-tracing-in-connect-mirror-maker-bridge-resources-{context}[Enable tracing for MirrorMaker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka Bridge]

* Set up tracing for clients:

** xref:proc-configuring-tracers-kafka-clients-{context}[Initialize a Jaeger tracer for Kafka clients]

* Instrument clients with tracers:

** xref:proc-instrumenting-producers-consumers-for-opentracing-{context}[Instrument producers and consumers for tracing]

** xref:proc-instrumenting-kafka-streams-with-tracers-{context}[Instrument Kafka Streams applications for tracing]

== Prerequisites

* The Jaeger backend components are deployed to your Kubernetes cluster. 
We recommend using the Jaeger operator for deploying Jaeger on your Kubernetes cluster.
For deployment instructions, see the {JaegerDocs}.
