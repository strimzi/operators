= Downgrading Strimzi

[role="_abstract"]
If you are encountering issues with the version of Strimzi you upgraded to,
you can revert your installation to the previous version.

If you used the YAML installation files to install Strimzi, you can use the YAML installation files from the previous release to perform the downgrade procedures.
You can downgrade Strimzi by updating the Cluster Operator and the version of Kafka you are using.
Kafka version downgrades are performed by the Cluster Operator.

WARNING: The following downgrade instructions are only suitable if you installed Strimzi using the installation files. 
If you installed Strimzi using another method, like {OperatorHub}, downgrade may not be supported by that method unless specified in their documentation. 
To ensure a successful downgrade process, it is essential to use a supported approach.
