= Upgrading the Cluster Operator

[role="_abstract"]
Use the same method to upgrade the Cluster Operator as the initial method of deployment.

Using installation files:: If you deployed the Cluster Operator using the installation YAML files, perform your upgrade by modifying the Operator installation files, as described in xref:proc-upgrading-the-co-{context}[Upgrading the Cluster Operator].

Using the OperatorHub.io:: If you deployed Strimzi from {OperatorHub}, use the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) to change the update channel for the Strimzi operators to a new Strimzi version.
+
Updating the channel starts one of the following types of upgrade, depending on your chosen upgrade strategy:
+
--
* An automatic upgrade is initiated
* A manual upgrade that requires approval before installation begins
--
+
NOTE: If you subscribe to the _stable_ channel, you can get automatic updates without changing channels.
However, enabling automatic updates is not recommended because of the potential for missing any pre-installation upgrade steps.
Use automatic upgrades only on version-specific channels.
+
For more information on using OperatorHub.io to upgrade Operators, see the {OLMOperatorDocs}.

Using a Helm chart:: If you deployed the Cluster Operator using a Helm chart, use `helm upgrade`.
+
The `helm upgrade` command does not upgrade the {HelmCustomResourceDefinitions}.
Install the new CRDs manually after upgrading the Cluster Operator.
You can access the CRDs from the {ReleaseDownload} or find them in the `crd` subdirectory inside the Helm Chart.

== Upgrading the Cluster Operator returns Kafka version error

If you upgrade the Cluster Operator and get an _unsupported Kafka version_ error, your Kafka cluster deployment has an older Kafka version that is not supported by the new operator version.
This error applies to all installation methods.

If this error occurs, upgrade Kafka to a supported Kafka version.
Change the `spec.kafka.version` in the `Kafka` resource to the supported version.

You can use `kubectl` to check for error messages like this in the `status` of the `Kafka` resource.

.Checking the Kafka status for errors
[source,shell, subs=+quotes]
----
kubectl get kafka _<kafka_cluster_name>_ -n _<namespace>_ -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions}'
----

Replace `_<kafka_cluster_name>_` with the name of your Kafka cluster and `_<namespace>_` with the Kubernetes namespace where the pod is running.
