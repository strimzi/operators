= FIPS support

[role="_abstract"]
Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are standards for computer security and interoperability.
When running Strimzi on a FIPS-enabled Kubernetes cluster, the OpenJDK used in Strimzi container images will automatically switch to FIPS mode.
From version 0.33, Strimzi can run on FIPS-enabled Kubernetes clusters without any changes or special configuration.
It will use only the FIPS compliant security libraries from the OpenJDK.

NOTE::
When running in the FIPS mode, SCRAM-SHA-512 passwords need to be at least 32 characters long.
To comply with this requirement, starting with Strimzi 0.33, the default password length in Strimzi User Operator is set to 32 characters as well.
If you have a Kafka cluster with custom configuration of the password length which is less than 32 characters, you will need to update your configuration.
If you have any existing users with passwords shorter than 32 characters, you will need to regenerate the password with the required length.
You can do that for example by deleting the user secret and waiting for the User Operator to create a new one with a new password using the new password length.
