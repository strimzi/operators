= Starting rolling updates of Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters using annotations

Strimzi supports the use of annotations on resources to manually trigger a rolling update of Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters through the Cluster Operator.
Rolling updates restart the pods of the resource with new ones.

Manually performing a rolling update on a specific pod or set of pods is usually only required in exceptional circumstances.
However, rather than deleting the pods directly, if you perform the rolling update through the Cluster Operator you ensure the following:

* The manual deletion of the pod does not conflict with simultaneous Cluster Operator operations, such as deleting other pods in parallel.
* The Cluster Operator logic handles the Kafka configuration specifications, such as the number of in-sync replicas.
