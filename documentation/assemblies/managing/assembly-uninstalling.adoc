= Uninstalling Strimzi

[role="_abstract"]
You can uninstall Strimzi using the CLI or by unsubscribing from OperatorHub.io.

Use the same approach you used to install Strimzi.

When you uninstall Strimzi, you will need to identify resources created specifically for a deployment and referenced from the Strimzi resource.

Such resources include:

* Secrets (Custom CAs and certificates, Kafka Connect secrets, and other Kafka secrets)
* Logging `ConfigMaps` (of type `external`)

These are resources referenced by `Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, or `KafkaBridge` configuration.

WARNING: Deleting a `CustomResourceDefinition` results in the garbage collection of the corresponding custom resources (`Kafka`, `KafkaConnect`, `KafkaMirrorMaker`, or `KafkaBridge`) and dependent resources  (`Deployment`, `Pod`, `Service`, and so on).
