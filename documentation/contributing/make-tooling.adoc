= Building the documentation locally

When you make changes to the documentation, it is a good practice to do a local test build to verify the book builds successfully and renders as you expect before you submit the merge request back to upstream main.

Make is a useful tool for building your documentation and pushing it to a public website so that peer and quality reviewers can see your edits as the user would.

== Building documentation using AsciiDoctor

As the documentation is based on asciidoc, you can use AsciiDoctor to build the guides locally.
To build a guide using AsciiDoctor on your local machine, you run the `asciidoctor` command for the source file of the guide. 

For example, this command builds the Overview:

[source,shell]
----
asciidoctor <path_to_overview.adoc>
----

== Building documentation with make commands

`make docu_clean`:: Delete all temporary files
`make docu_check`:: Execute the documentation checks in `.azure/scripts/check_docs.sh`
`make docu_html`:: Generate the HTML version of all the guides (the HTML files can be found in `documentation/html)
`make docu_htmlnoheader`:: Generate the HTML version of all the guides without the HTML headers so they are suitable for including into a website (the HTML files can be found in `documentation/htmlnoheader)

== Generating the Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference

The `documentation/modules/appendix_crds.adoc` file provides the main content for the _Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference_.
It is generated directly from the Java code when building the operators.

If you change the Strimzi API, you need to regenerate the API Reference before submitting your PR by running the following from the root:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn clean -DskipTests install
make crd_install
----

The build uses https://github.com/mikefarah/yq[`yq`^], so make sure it is kept up-to-date for it to work properly.

NOTE: You only have to generate the _Strimzi Custom Resource API Reference_ if you changed anything in the `api` module of the Java code.
