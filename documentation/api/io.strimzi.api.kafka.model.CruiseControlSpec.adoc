Configures a Cruise Control cluster.

Configuration options relate to:

* Goals configuration
* Capacity limits for resource distribution goals

[id='property-cruise-control-config-{context}']
=== `config`

Use the `config` properties to configure Cruise Control options as keys.

Standard Cruise Control configuration may be provided, restricted to those properties not managed directly by Strimzi.

Configuration options that cannot be configured relate to the following:

* Security (Encryption, Authentication, and Authorization)
* Connection to the Kafka cluster
* Client ID configuration
* ZooKeeper connectivity
* Web server configuration
* Self healing

The values can be one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

You can specify and configure the options listed in the {CruiseControlConfigDocs} with the exception of those options that are managed directly by Strimzi.
See the description of the `config` property for a list of forbidden prefixes.

When a forbidden option is present in the `config` property, it is ignored and a warning message is printed to the Cluster Operator log file.
All other supported options are passed to Cruise Control.

There are exceptions to the forbidden options.
For client connection using a specific _cipher suite_ for a TLS version, you can xref:con-common-configuration-ssl-reference[configure allowed `ssl` properties].
You can also configure `webserver` properties to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

[id='property-cruise-control-config-cors-{context}']
=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a HTTP mechanism for controlling access to REST APIs.
Restrictions can be on access methods or originating URLs of client applications.
You can enable CORS with Cruise Control using the `webserver.http.cors.enabled` property in the `config`.
When enabled, CORS permits read access to the Cruise Control REST API from applications that have different originating URLs than Strimzi.
This allows applications from specified origins to use `GET` requests to fetch information about the Kafka cluster through the Cruise Control API.
For example, applications can fetch information on the current cluster load or the most recent optimization proposal.
`POST` requests are not permitted.

NOTE: For more information on using CORS with Cruise Control, see {CruiseControlApiDocs}.

.Enabling CORS for Cruise Control

You enable and configure CORS in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl.config`.

      webserver.http.cors.origin: "*" # <2>
      webserver.http.cors.exposeheaders: "User-Task-ID,Content-Type" # <3>

    # ...
----
<1> Enables CORS.
<2> Specifies permitted origins for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP response header. You can use a wildcard or specify a single origin as a URL. If you use a wildcard, a response is returned following requests from any origin.
<3> Exposes specified header names for the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` HTTP response header. Applications in permitted origins can read responses with the specified headers.

=== Cruise Control REST API security

The Cruise Control REST API is secured with HTTP Basic authentication and SSL to protect the cluster against potentially destructive Cruise Control operations, such as decommissioning Kafka brokers.
We recommend that Cruise Control in Strimzi is **only used with these settings enabled**.

However, it is possible to disable these settings by specifying the following Cruise Control configuration:

* To disable the built-in HTTP Basic authentication, set `webserver.security.enable` to `false`.
* To disable the built-in SSL, set `webserver.ssl.enable` to `false`.

[id='property-cruise-control-broker-capacity-{context}']
=== brokerCapacity

Cruise Control uses capacity limits to determine if optimization goals for resource distribution are being broken.
There are four goals of this type:

* `DiskUsageDistributionGoal`            - Disk utilization distribution
* `CpuUsageDistributionGoal`             - CPU utilization distribution
* `NetworkInboundUsageDistributionGoal`  - Network inbound utilization distribution
* `NetworkOutboundUsageDistributionGoal` - Network outbound utilization distribution

You specify capacity limits for Kafka broker resources in the `brokerCapacity` property in `Kafka.spec.cruiseControl` .
They are enabled by default and you can change their default values.
Capacity limits can be set for the following broker resources:

* `inboundNetwork`  - Inbound network throughput in byte units per second (Default: 10000KiB/s)
* `outboundNetwork` - Outbound network throughput in byte units per second (Default: 10000KiB/s)

For network throughput, use an integer value with standard Kubernetes byte units (K, M, G) or their bibyte (power of two) equivalents (Ki, Mi, Gi) per second.

NOTE: Disk and CPU capacity limits are automatically generated by Strimzi, so you do not need to set them.

[NOTE]
====
In order to guarantee accurate rebalance proposal when using CPU goals, you can set CPU requests equal to CPU limits in `Kafka.spec.kafka.resources`.
That way, all CPU resources are reserved upfront and are always available.
This configuration allows Cruise Control to properly evaluate the CPU utilization when preparing the rebalance proposals based on CPU goals.

[id='property-cruise-control-capacity-overrides-{context}']
=== Capacity overrides

Brokers might be running on nodes with heterogeneous network resources.
If that's the case, specify `overrides` that set the network capacity limits for each broker.
The overrides ensure an accurate rebalance between the brokers.
Override capacity limits can be set for the following broker resources:

* `inboundNetwork`  - Inbound network throughput in byte units per second (Default: 10000KiB/s)
* `outboundNetwork` - Outbound network throughput in byte units per second (Default: 10000KiB/s)

[id='property-cruise-control-logging-{context}']
=== Logging configuration

Cruise Control has its own configurable logger:

* `rootLogger.level`

Cruise Control uses the Apache `log4j2` logger implementation.

Use the `logging` property to configure loggers and logger levels.

You can set the log levels by specifying the logger and level directly (inline) or use a custom (external) ConfigMap.
If a ConfigMap is used, you set `logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.name` property to the name of the ConfigMap containing the external logging configuration. Inside the ConfigMap, the logging configuration is described using `log4j.properties`. Both `logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.name` and `logging.valueFrom.configMapKeyRef.key` properties are mandatory. A ConfigMap using the exact logging configuration specified is created with the custom resource when the Cluster Operator is running, then recreated after each reconciliation. If you do not specify a custom ConfigMap, default logging settings are used. If a specific logger value is not set, upper-level logger settings are inherited for that logger.
Here we see examples of `inline` and `external` logging.

.Garbage collector (GC)

Garbage collector logging can also be enabled (or disabled) using the xref:con-common-configuration-garbage-collection-reference[`jvmOptions` property].
