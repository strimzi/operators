Configures broker settings for listeners.

Example configuration for the `host`, `nodePort`, `loadBalancerIP`, and `annotations` properties is shown in the xref:type-GenericKafkaListenerConfiguration-reference[`GenericKafkaListenerConfiguration` schema] section.

= Overriding advertised addresses for brokers

By default, Strimzi tries to automatically determine the hostnames and ports that your Kafka cluster advertises to its clients.
This is not sufficient in all situations, because the infrastructure on which Strimzi is running might not provide the right hostname or port through which Kafka can be accessed.

You can specify a broker ID and customize the advertised hostname and port in the `configuration` property of the listener.
Strimzi will then automatically configure the advertised address in the Kafka brokers and add it to the broker certificates so it can be used for TLS hostname verification.
Overriding the advertised host and ports is available for all types of listeners.

      brokers:
      - broker: 0
        advertisedHost: example.hostname.0
        advertisedPort: 12340
      - broker: 1
        advertisedHost: example.hostname.1
        advertisedPort: 12341
      - broker: 2
        advertisedHost: example.hostname.2
        advertisedPort: 12342

Instead of specifying the `advertisedHost` field for every broker, you can also use an `advertisedHostTemplate` to generate them automatically.
The `advertisedHostTemplate` supports the following variables:

* The `{nodeId}` variable is replaced with the ID of the Kafka node to which the template is applied.
* The `{nodePodName}` variable is replaced with the Kubernetes pod name for the Kafka node where the template is applied.
