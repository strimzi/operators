Use `deploymentStrategy` to specify the strategy used to replace old pods with new ones when deployment configuration changes.

Use one of the following values:

- `RollingUpdate`: Pods are restarted with zero downtime.
- `Recreate`: Pods are terminated before new ones are created.

Using the `Recreate` deployment strategy has the advantage of not requiring spare `Node` resources, but the disadvantage of application downtime.

.Example showing the deployment strategy set to `Recreate`.
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]

# ...
template:
  deployment:
    deploymentStrategy: Recreate
# ...

This configuration change does not cause a rolling update.
