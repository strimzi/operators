Use `deploymentStrategy` to specify the strategy used to replace old Pods by new ones on configuration changes.

The value can be:

- RollingUpdate: Pods are restarted with zero downtime.
- Recreate: Pods are terminated before new ones are created.

Using "Recreate" deployment strategy has the advantage of not requiring spare Node resources, but the disadvantage of application downtime.

.Example of setting the deployment strategy to "Recreate".
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
# ...
template:
  deployment:
    deploymentStrategy: Recreate
# ...
----

This configuration change does not cause a rolling update.
