 * DisabledScramCredentialsOperator is used when the use of SCRAM-SHA users is not allowed. It does not provide any
 * functionality and throws UnsupportedOperationException exception when used. The logic in KafkaUserOperator class
 * should make sure it is never called, but having this special implementation makes sure we do not need to keep around
 * the proper ScramCredentialsOperator with its cache and batch reconciler etc. And in case it is somewhere called by
 * mistake, the unsupported exceptions make it easier to detect it.
